# This is my first project:-

Subject: landing page.

I hope to be successful in using the tools that I have learned to implement what is required of me in this project.

I created a logo and link it with html to go to the frist page when clicked.

I created a function to create a link for each section.

Modified the active class properties for both section and link with interSectionObserver.

I made an icon to go to the top of the page and appear after scroll.

I made the icon appear after scaling to 450 pixels.

I made the link header disappear after 8 seconds and reappear with just a scroll.

                                            with my best wishes,,,
